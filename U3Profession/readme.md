# Profession Management
## Description
This project is a simple web-based application to manage employees. Users can add employee details (name, profession, and age), view the list of added employees, and delete employees as needed. The app utilizes localStorage to persist the data even after the page is refreshed.

## Features
### Add Employee:
- Input fields for Name, Profession, and Age.
- Validation to ensure all fields are filled before adding an employee.

### Display Employees:
- A list of all added employees is displayed below the input section.
- Shows a message when there are no employees added (e.g., "You have 0 Employees.").

### Delete Employee:
- Each employee entry has a delete button to remove that employee from the list.
- Persistent Storage:
- Data is saved to localStorage to ensure it remains even after refreshing the page.

### Responsive UI:
- The design is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5: For the structure of the web page.
- CSS3: For styling the UI to maintain a sleek, dark theme.
- JavaScript: For DOM manipulation and managing application logic.
